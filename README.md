News dashboard created calling public news API

The JavaScript code makes requests to a public API and updates the HTML page with the data received from the news server. However, when hosted on GitHub Pages, these API calls fail because the API restricts requests to localhost only.

Additionally, I have included a screen recording in the root folder of the repository.Kindly download and watch the video.
